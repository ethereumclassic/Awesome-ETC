# Overview
>Launched on July 30, 2015, Ethereum Classic is a distributed blockchain computing platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications. Its native token is ether (ETC), which primarily serves as a reserve currency for transactions on the Ethereum Classic network. In the greater, interoperable Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem, Ethereum Classic is the original, *unaltered state* Ethereum chain.

**Ethereum project splits in a contentious hard fork**
>On July 20, 2016, an event known as ["the DAO hack"](https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/the-dao-the-hack-the-soft-fork-and-the-hard-fork/) resulted in a contentious hard fork of the Ethereum project. An unnamed sister chain with an irregular state change was born. The rights to the Ethereum project's brand are owned by the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization that was a proponent of the new sister chain. The Ethereum Foundation applied their "Ethereum" brand and "ETH" ticker symbol to the new sister chain.

<div align="center">
  <img width="600px" src="./images/ethereum_contentious_hard_fork.png">
  </div>

**Rebranding from Ethereum (ETH) to Ethereum Classic (ETC)**

>Initially, Ethereum Classic was only traded publicly on Bitsquare (now called [Bisq](https://bisq.network/markets/?currency=etc_btc)) and within a forum post on [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org). On July 23, 2016, [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com) recognized Ethereum Classic by listing it on their exchange and opening the first [ETC/BTC](https://poloniex.com/exchange#btc_etc) market. Proponents of the unaltered, original state Ethereum chain adopted the new brand identity of "Ethereum Classic", the color green, and the "ETC" ticker symbol. A formal [Declaration of Independence](https://ethereumclassic.org/DeclarationOfIndependence/) was issued to the world and the unaltered, original state Ethereum chain rose from the ashes of its most notable social engineering attack.

### Games

- [Alien Farm](https://alienfarm.highlander.network/) - Idle Alien Farm is the #1 Alien farming simulator and idle game on the blockchain. The more Alien you have, the more eggs they lay (each Alien lays at a rate of 1 per day). Hatch more Alien with your eggs to multiply your production, or cash them out for ETC!
- [Arena Racing](https://arena.highlander.network/) - 5 players enter the stage to race to the finish. Every player pays 0.1 ETC to race. 1 player in the Arena loses the race but receives dividends from P3C which is bought every round and is locked up in the contract.
- [ETCOdyssey](https://etcodyssey.com/) - Upgrade your ships to avoid raiders looking to steal your Dark Matter & Star Dust. Fuse in game StarDust for a percentage of the pot or convert your StarDust for ONEX Network tokens sent with 1 transaction to your wallet.
- [Luckygames](https://luckygames.cc/) - Ethereum Classic Dice and Gambling site.

### Compatible Decentralized Identity Dapps
- [Bloom](https://bloom.co/) - BloomID eliminates the need for usernames and passwords. Simply scan a BloomID-enabled QR code or click “Log In with Bloom” to securely access apps and websites. Log In with Bloom helps mitigate fraud and prevents you from falling victim to credential stuffing attacks.

### Interoperability Projects
- [Binance Chain to Ethereum networks](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/eth-bnc-bridge/about-eth-bnc-bridge) - The ETH-to-BNC bridge combines the TokenBridge approach with a TSS to approve relay operations and facilitate asset transfer between an EVM chain and the Binance chain.
- [TokenBridge](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/) - The TokenBridge allows users to transfer data (e.g. digital asset ownership information) between two chains in the Ethereum ecosystem. Cross-chain bridges provide fast and secure connections between blockchains, creating scalability and connection - interoperability - between Ethereum networks.
- [wBTC](https://www.wbtc.network/) - Wrapped Bitcoin delivers the power of Bitcoin
with the flexibility of an ERC20 token
- [wETC](https://wetc.app/) - The Ethereum Classic Bridge connects ETC to ETH, where ETC is available as WETC on the Ethereum (ETH) chain.

### Open Finance Dapps and Protocols
- [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.gg) - The World’s Savings Fund. Immutable. Built 2018.
- [ePOC](https://etc.poc35.co/) - Proof-of-Stake Token on Ethereum Classic Network. This is an alternative method to the more widely known process used by bitcoin; Proof of Work (POW).

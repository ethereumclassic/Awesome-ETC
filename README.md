# Overview
>Launched on July 30, 2015, Ethereum Classic is a distributed blockchain computing platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications. Its native token is ether (ETC), which primarily serves as a reserve currency for transactions on the Ethereum Classic network. In the greater, interoperable Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem, Ethereum Classic is the original, *unaltered state* Ethereum chain.

**Ethereum project splits in a contentious hard fork**
>On July 20, 2016, an event known as ["the DAO hack"](https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/the-dao-the-hack-the-soft-fork-and-the-hard-fork/) resulted in a contentious hard fork of the Ethereum project. An unnamed sister chain with an irregular state change was born. The rights to the Ethereum project's brand are owned by the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization that was a proponent of the new sister chain. The Ethereum Foundation applied their "Ethereum" brand and "ETH" ticker symbol to the new sister chain.

  </div>

**Rebranding from Ethereum (ETH) to Ethereum Classic (ETC)**

>Initially, Ethereum Classic was only traded publicly on Bitsquare (now called [Bisq](https://bisq.network/markets/?currency=etc_btc)) and within a forum post on [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org). On July 23, 2016, [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com) recognized Ethereum Classic by listing it on their exchange and opening the first [ETC/BTC](https://poloniex.com/exchange#btc_etc) market. Proponents of the unaltered, original state Ethereum chain adopted the new brand identity of "Ethereum Classic", the color green, and the "ETC" ticker symbol. A formal [Declaration of Independence](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/DeclarationOfIndependence) was issued to the world and the unaltered, original state Ethereum chain rose from the ashes of its most notable social engineering attack.

# Ethereum Classic Ecosystem

<div align="left">
  <img alt="Ethereum Classic Logo" src="./images/ethereum_classic_button_full.png">
</div>

## DApp Environment
### Games
- [Arena Racing](https://arena.highlander.network/) - 5 players enter the stage to race to the finish. Every player pays 0.1 ETC to race. 1 player in the Arena loses the race but receives dividends from P3C which is bought every round and is locked up in the contract.
- [Aqua Bank](https://aqua.xenobank.com/) - In this game you take care about whale. Fish lives in a protected area with other endangered species. Player is supposed to feed the whale using plankton in order to let it grow. Whale also produces oil as it consumes plankton. Oil and whale meat slices are requested at the Port, where they also supply plankton for feeding. Relax by watching fish in the aquarium grow
- [Commonwealth Country](https://commonwealth.gg/country.html) - Generate an immutable new Country based on your ETC Address.
- [ETCOdyssey](https://etcodyssey.com/) - Upgrade your ships to avoid raiders looking to steal your Dark Matter & Star Dust. Fuse in game StarDust for a percentage of the pot or convert your StarDust for ONEX Network tokens sent with 1 transaction to your wallet.
- [Luckygames](https://luckygames.cc/) - Ethereum Classic Dice and Gambling site.

### Decentralized Identity DApps
- [OriginalMy](https://originalmy.com/) - Building trust in corporate governance. Seamlessly authenticating: identities, authorisation signatures, and digital content.
a global public utility for self-sovereign identity
- [Stampery](https://stampery.com/) - We leverage blockchain technology to ensure the existence, integrity and attribution of communications, processes and data important for your organization.

### EVM Interoperability Projects
- [BTC-to-wBTC](https://wbtc.network/) - Wrapped Bitcoin delivers the power of Bitcoin with the flexibility of an ERC20 token. Bitcoin tokenized on EVMs.
- [ETC-to-wETC](https://wetc.app/) - The Ethereum Classic Bridge connects ETC-to-ETH, where ETC is available as wETC on the Ethereum (ETH) chain.
- [EVM-to-BNC Bridge](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/eth-bnc-bridge/about-eth-bnc-bridge) - The EVM-to-BNC bridge combines the TokenBridge approach with a TSS to approve relay operations and facilitate asset transfer between an EVM chain and the Binance chain.
- [Token Bridge](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/) - The TokenBridge allows users to transfer data (e.g. digital asset ownership information) between two chains in the Ethereum ecosystem. Cross-chain bridges provide fast and secure connections between blockchains, creating scalability and connection - interoperability - between Ethereum EVM networks.

### Open Finance Dapps and Protocols
- [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.gg) - The World’s Savings Fund. Immutable. Built 2018.
- [ePOC](https://etc.poc35.co/) - ePoC is based on a ETC smart contract run on the ethereum blockchain. It’s modeled after Powh3D.
- [GitCoin](https://gitcoin.co/) - Crowdfunding and Freelance Developers for Open Source Software Projects.
- [ONEX Network](https://onex.network/) - Proof-of-Stake Token on Ethereum Classic Network. This is an alternative method to the more widely known process used by bitcoin; Proof of Work (POW).

### Other Projects
- [Grayscale® Ethereum Classic Trust](https://grayscale.co/ethereum-classic-trust/) - Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust enables investors to gain exposure to the price movement of ETC through a traditional investment vehicle, without the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping ETC.
- [Portal.Network](https://www.portal.network/) - Blockchain Name Service enables connections with IPFS hash, smart contract, and wallet address.
- [XAR Network](https://xar.network/) - Xar Network was created from a need of corporate and central banks to use blockchain technology in a private, permissioned space. As our feature set grew we noticed consistent cross-over with the decentralized finance ecosystem, so eventually the Xar toolkit grew to a full-fledged decentralized finance toolbox. Xar Network offers access to advantages of both purely traditional banking systems and blockchain systems - using blockchain based or decentralized finance (DeFi).

## Social Channels
### Public Service Announcement
There is **NO OFFICIAL ANYTHING**.
>Ethereum Classic is an open source, decentralized project with a global *permissionless* ecosystem. Ethereum Classic's history is checkered with attempts at social attacks on the Ethereum Classic network and it's `assets` or `commons` (e.g.; code repository, website, brand, network history). We see similar social engineering in the Bitcoin ecosystem. It's a negative externality that comes with a truly decentralized project.

- [Unstoppable Code: The Difference Between Can't and Won't](https://youtu.be/Q6euy5W1js4) -  In this talk, Andreas discusses what is interesting about both Bitcoin and Ethereum: unstoppable code. He looks at cryptography and decentralized systems as defensive mechanisms to assert and enforce our human rights, and the effect of the Silk Road on the public's perception of cryptocurrencies. He also warns that the Ethereum community will soon need to reconcile diverse ethical codes and legal jurisdictions, and make a decision about whether they will build "won't" or "can't" governance systems. What is the unstoppable code worth running?
